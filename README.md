# Regression of Used Car Prices

The goal of this competition is to predict the price of used cars based on various attributes.

Evaluation is done using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

RMSE = (1/N * Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)^2)^(1/2)

where:
- N is the number of observations
- y_i is the actual price
- ŷ_i is the predicted price
